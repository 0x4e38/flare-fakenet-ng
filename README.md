FakeNet-NG is a next generation dynamic network analysis tool for malware
analysts and penetration testers. It is open source and designed for the latest 
versions of Windows. FakeNet-NG is based on the excellent Fakenet tool developed
by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski.

The tool allows you to intercept and redirect all or specific network traffic 
while simulating legitimate network services. Using FakeNet-NG, malware analysts
can quickly identify malware’s functionality and capture network signatures. 
Penetration testers and bug hunters will find FakeNet-NG’s configurable 
interception engine and modular framework highly useful when testing 
application’s specific functionality and prototyping PoCs.
